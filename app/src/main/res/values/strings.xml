    <string name="sample_highlight_text"> The Three Kingdoms period refers to the part of Chinese history when three states fought against each other to conquer the whole China.   Many legendary Chinese heroes and fascinating war time stories came from this period.    In this workshop, we will play a popular card game named “Legends of the Three Kingdoms” which is inspired by this part of history, and share the real life historical stories behind.  If you are eager to learn more about the history of the Three Kingdoms, or you are a card-game maniac, this activity will not disappoint you!  Don’t miss the chance! Hiking is an integral part of Hong Kong culture.   Being big fans of hiking ourselves, we would like to invite non-local students to join us for a hike at the Shing Mun Reservoir.   After the hike, we will visit a local restaurant for a dim sum lunch.  Don’t miss this opportunity to meet new friends, enjoy the beautiful nature and good food, and learn more about the local lifestyles!</string>
